## Innovation for All Part One ##
Presentation by Adrienne Bodor.
To "innovate" means: to make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas or products.


## Data Visualization ##
Presentation by Manuel Leuthold.
[This video](https://vimeo.com/37069844) shows data visualization from Interactive Things, alumni interaction design students from the ZHdK. They did this for the Ville Vivante in Geneva.
Manuel Leuthold talked about the importance of good data visualization. And how it is an incredibly effective tool to get people not only interested in your findings, but first and foremost to have them understand them. It is also very important to give people a story on how to convey your data. ![Napoleon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Minard.png/1920px-Minard.png?1494276277956)
This example shows the strength and size of Napoleon's army during the march to russia.

The day was rounded up with an exercise where we where asked to take anything and make a quick visualization from it. It was very interesting to see the different aproaches.
