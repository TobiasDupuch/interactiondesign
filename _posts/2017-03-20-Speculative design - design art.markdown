## Design of 'What if?' ##
Presentation by Juyoung Yi.
What is the difference between a true interaction and a mimicry? Where is the border between speculative design and art? Is interaction with objects another form of life?
Methods of speculative Design:
- world and context
- observe vs uncanny
- idea and reality
Ju's lessons learned:
"While studying the speculative design, I could learn those different perspectives of thinking toward time, objects and technology can open new possibilities for designers with their projects and products."

## Interaction design & art##
Presentation by Carlo Natter.
Speculative design is:
- Evidence-based
- Considers cultural elements
- consider scientific laws
- predicts what the future of design could be
In speculative design there is the term design fiction. Like sci-fi, design fiction imagines whole worlds and stories. For example the project [United Micro Kingdom](http://www.unitedmicrokingdoms.org/)
