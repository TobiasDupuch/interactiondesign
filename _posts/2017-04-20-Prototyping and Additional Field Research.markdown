## Giving People and Idea ##
This weeks goal was to make a prototype and then go talk to people again with it. This gives them a better understanding of what we ask and puts them in a different position then just asking them fully rhetorical questions.

## The Fridge ##
To have a system we came up with stages of an automated fridge. People know what a fridge is supposed to do, they are familiar with what it is and what it does and everybody has one at home. The object would become more automated with every stage. It would give the users something he wants and in return taking control away from him a little bit more with every stage.

## Building the Physical Prototype ##
To have a quick way of creating a prototype which gives people a feeling of what the fridge does we decided to laser cut the whole object. There was a slot where we put in an iPad. The screen would then show different reactions of the fridge to the users behavior.

## Conclusion ##
The Prototype actually worked for us. It gave people more insight in the situation we asked them about. It was the first time in this project where we got concrete responses from the people we asked. It was then that the idea of "The Room" started really taking of in our team.
