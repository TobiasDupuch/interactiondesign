## Narrowing Down ##
By week two we had a wall full of ideas which were very wide-spread. The task we had to do now was to narrow down. So we started to group the ideas and dismissing those we all didn't want to do. We where still left with a few post-its on the wall.

## Very, very Rapid Prototype ##
Still trying to narrow down we created a quick prototype out of garbage we found lying around. It was very hard to make something concrete since we did not yet know what we wanted to do really. The time pressure and the lack of resources made us create an all-knowing AI/coffee machine.

## Narrowing Down again ##
With the idea of the all-knowing AI coffee machine working it's way in our head we went back to take a look at our field research.
Having some context it started to become clear, that most answers revolved around loss of control and not understanding the automated process and where it's data comes from. It was very clear, that this should be the direction we want to go.

## Desk Research and Related Work ##
After some desk research we found a few related works. Still thinking about the workshop, it was [The Glass Room (https://theglassroomnyc.org)] which caught our attention the most. For research purposes we ordered the "Springer Handbook of Automation" which definitively is anything but a "handbook".
