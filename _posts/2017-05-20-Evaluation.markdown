## Evaluation of the Room ##
For this day we came up with a few points which would help us to evaluate if our Room project did what it was supposed to do. These where:
- Did we provoke people to think about automation in their lives?
- Was our installation focused enough?
- Did the people feel immersed in the experience of the room?
- Was our installation bias?
- Did we cover a significant enough part of automation?
- What did we personally take anything away from our installation?

The others then evaluated our evaluation, which was a pretty interesting experiment, because it gives new perspectives. And then we re-evaluated the evaluation which sometimes gave even more insight.

Evaluation is hard. It is always tricky to stay objective. There are different approached to evaluation from different fields and particularly in design you have to figure out which one gives you what you want to achieve.
