## The Zimbabwe bush pump ##
Presentation by Tobias Jud.
Zimbabwe deals with a lot of bad water related illnesses. A very infamous example of design in the everyday context is the Zimbabwe bush pump, which had, and still has, a great impact on the people of Zimbabwe. The Pump was designed and is produced in Zimbabwe. It is fairly easily installable by the people of a village and doesn't require machines. The buyer of such a bush pump receives instructions on where to build the well and how to construct the pump. This makes for a very cheap and sustainable way of reducing water related illness.
