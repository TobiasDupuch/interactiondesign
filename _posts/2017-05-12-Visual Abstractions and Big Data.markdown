## Data as a new currency ##
Presentation by Alessa Gassmann.
Data is the oil of our century. It is harvested and traded. Of course this has come with the internet and new technologies.
Other than the usual suspects, the government is one of the biggest collectors or producers of data. The government also regulates – to some extend – the collection and trading of data. On the other hand it uses data itself to "improve health and life overall."

## Data Visualization ##
Presentation by Manuel Leuthold.
[This video](https://vimeo.com/37069844) shows data visualization from Interactive Things, alumni interaction design students from the ZHdK. They did this for the Ville Vivante in Geneva.
Manuel Leuthold talked about the importance of good data visualization. And how it is an incredibly effective tool to get people not only interested in your findings, but first and foremost to have them understand them. It is also very important to give people a story on how to convey your data. ![Napoleon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Minard.png/1920px-Minard.png?1494276277956)
This example shows the strength and size of Napoleon's army during the march to russia.

The day was rounded up with an exercise where we where asked to take anything and make a quick visualization from it. It was very interesting to see the different aproaches.
