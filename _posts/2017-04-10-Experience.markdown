## Experience ##
Presentation by Katharina Durrer.
Interaction + User = User Experience. When you design something for humans there always will be an experience that the user gets from it. This experience can be split into three stages: Before, during and after the use of the designed X.
Of course this a very important part for an interaction designer but also is a very hard thing to do right. Since the design and the intended experience very often doesn't match with the actual experience.

## The experience is the product ##
Presentation by Ismael Möri.
Let's travel trough time a little with this ad:
! [Kodak Ad](http://customerceobook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-first-Kodak-camera-ca-005.jpg).
In a time when operating Cameras was very hard and required a lot of knowledge Kodak invented a Camera everybody could use. It was not only a product but also the service of developing the pictures. It was such a great user experience that Kodak managed to change Photography forever.

Ismael Möri then went on to compare three phones. A Nokia 3310 which did very well what it was supposed to do. Then one of the phones with a internet browser before the iphone and the iphone.
The lession was that even if the phones may have the same features, it is essential to have a good user experience for those features because else they become irrelevant.
