## Reading Week ##
As we laid out the plans for our next steps the week before, it was time to get serious. We had a whole week to work on our project so it was perfect timing.

## The Scripts ##
Since we decided to film interviews we had to think more about those. In the filmed interviews one user who does not see any problem whatsoever with automatization talks about how great the object he owns is and how nicely it works. The viewer should from the subtly satirical way understand that something must be wrong.

## The Objects ##
While i started writing the scripts, Carlo Natter laid out the first sketches for the objects' design. His idea was to combine 3D printed parts and Plexiglass.

## Object Production ##
3D Printing the objects took a lot of time since the technique requires a lot of testing and supervision. For the pill we tried out a casting the pill around the skeleton with silicon. We had to thermoform a negative first. The approach didn't work out because the silicon was to bubbly and we lost control of where the skeleton would replace itself in the pill.

All the other objects where time intensive but worked out pretty well afters some iteration.

## Installation Prep ##
Since we didn't get to build the room we had to move that to the last week. So we just did the preparations like renting iPads and finding a room that fits our purpose.
