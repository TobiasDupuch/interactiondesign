Presentation by Aurelian Ammon
What is the difference between a true interaction and a mimicry? Where is the border between speculative design and art? Is interaction with objects another form of life?
Methods of speculative Design:
- world and context
- observe vs uncanny
- idea and reality
Ju's lessons learned:
"While studying the speculative design, I could learn those different perspectives of thinking toward time, objects and technology can open new possibilities for designers with their projects and products."

- Considers cultural elements
- consider scientific laws
- predicts what the future of design could be
